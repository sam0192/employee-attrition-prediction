# Employee Attrition Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting **employee attrition** using HR analytics data.
Machine learning classification models are applied to identify employees who are likely to leave the organization.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Employee attrition leads to increased hiring costs and loss of productivity.
The objective of this project is to build a classification model that predicts whether an employee will **leave the company**
based on demographic, job-related, and performance-related features.
